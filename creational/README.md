# Creational patterns

These patterns are about object creation.
Rather than just instantiating a class directly, we get help and delegate object creation to these patterns.

* Class scope
  * [Factory Method](class/factory-method/README.md)

* Object scope
  * [Abstract Factory](object/abstract-factory/README.md)
