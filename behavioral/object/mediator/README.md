**Mediator design pattern**

This pattern gets its name from an object which acts as a "mediator".  
This mediator object sits between set of objects that want to communicate with each other.  
The objects that want to communicate do not have to know about each other(this is the reason why this pattern exist).  
They just know the mediator.  
With this pattern, communication between objects is "encapsulated" within a mediator object  
This way dependencies are reduced between communicating objects so is coupling.
