**Decorator Pattern**

This pattern allows us to `add responsibilities` to `objects` `dynamically`.  
Decorators provide `flexible alternative` to `subclassing` for `extending functionality`.  
Add `behaviour`, `state` to objects at `run-time`.

Helps
* Open-Closed principle (Class should be closed for modification but open for extension)
* Object composition over inheritance
* Single Responsibility Principle (Pattern allows functionality to be divided between classes with unique areas of concern)

Similar to
* Chain of Responsibility Pattern (Exactly one of the classes handles the request. In decorator, all classes handle the request)
