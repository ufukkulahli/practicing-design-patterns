**Composite pattern**

We need to treat `a group of objects` as they were `a single same unit`.  
So they share a `common inteface` and `behaviours` as well.  
Then `compose` them in a way like `tree`.  
Finally, let the `client` consume the tree by `iterating` over each `object` and `invoke` behaviour.
Produce result(s) with the gathered knowledge/visited object.
