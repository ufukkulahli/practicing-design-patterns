# Flyweight pattern

Allows 'sharing' data to many other similar objects by constructing a 'flyweight' object.  
This flyweight object gets used by the 'heavy' objects to minimize resource usage.

This model consists of two parts: one to represent the intrinsic state (kept in a flyweight object) and the other is to represent the extrinsic state (client objects keep).
