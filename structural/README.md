# Structural patterns

These patterns are about `class` and `object` composition.  
Structural class-creation patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces.  
Structural object-patterns define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionality.  
We use these patterns to form large object structures between many disparate objects.
